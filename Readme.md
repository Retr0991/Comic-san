This Version is supposed to web scrape the images from the websites and then create cbz
The sites have mostly webp images, which helps in preserving the quality of the images while keepin the size small. Some might have jpg images, which increases the size of the created cbz.

Use local bot api server to handle cbz of size > 50MB

tto lazy to commit the large amount of untracked code on the vm. Will need to write the whole code again in a sober state
